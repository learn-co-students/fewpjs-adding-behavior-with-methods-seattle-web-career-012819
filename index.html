  If you stand in the middle of the woods for long enough you kind of realize how little your limbs, bones, everything about you is -- it's fun when you think about that in comparison to the sky, space, trees, etc, whatever, but in the middle of the woods there's other shit to worry about. cougars. bears. other people who are even slightly larger than you. how the fuck would you fight off a bear? you can't climb a tree better than a bear. you can't run faster than a bear. your dog would be afraid but she would throw herself at the bear if it came for you -- then your dog would die and you would be face to face with a bear. 
  You think of this at 3:15pm. You are 6 miles out -- it's been a beautiful hike. for a long time you're just standing there, feeling tiny and horrified at how you might let that happen to your dog.
